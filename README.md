## Conclusion

The Monte Carlo method was employed to estimate the value of the integral of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) over the interval [0, 2]. The analytical value of the integral was computed to be approximately 2.6667. 

For \( n = 10000 \), the Monte Carlo method estimated the integral to be approximately 2.6192, resulting in an absolute error of 0.0475 compared to the analytical value. This indicates that the Monte Carlo method may need more samples to achieve accurate estimation for this value of \( n \).

However, for \( n = 100000 \), the estimated value of the integral using the Monte Carlo method was approximately 2.6735, yielding an absolute error of 0.0069. This suggests that the Monte Carlo method provides an accurate estimation of the integral for larger values of \( n \).

In conclusion, the Monte Carlo method demonstrates its effectiveness in estimating integrals, particularly as the number of samples increases. However, it may require a larger number of samples to achieve accurate estimation for certain functions or intervals.
